AVR ISP Touch
-------------

AVR ISP Touch is a 6-pin ISP connector for AVR programming which does not require any part on the PCB, but an adapter for a common 6-pin programmer. This repository contains an Eagle CAD project for the ISP adapter.

You can find the Eagle library containing the part to use this ISP header in your projects at https://github.com/daspilker/daspilker-eagle-library.
