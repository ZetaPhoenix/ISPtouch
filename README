ISPtouch for AVR Microcontrollers
---------------------------------

ISPtouch is a 6-pin ISP connector for AVR programming which does not require any part on the PCB, but an adapter for a common 6-pin programmer. This repository contains an Eagle CAD project for the ISPtouch adapter. For details see http://daniel-spilker.com/blog/2011/04/25/isptouch-for-avr-microcontrollers/.

You can find the Eagle library containing the part to use this ISP header in your projects at https://github.com/daspilker/daspilker-eagle-library.
